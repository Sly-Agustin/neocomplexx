To use access your local database:
- Use the env.sample file as template, create a .env file and fill with your database credentials

To mount the database in docker it's required to have docker installed, if you don't have it download from here `https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/`
The database uses port 3306 to comunicate, which is usually the default port for MySQL, stop this service before trying to mount the docker database. In Windows this can be done with `net stop MySQL80`. In GNU/Linux `sudo /etc/init.d/mysql stop`.
- To start the database run `docker-compose up`
- Migrate tables to the database with `npm run migrateEverything`
- Upload placeholder data with `npm run seedEverything`
